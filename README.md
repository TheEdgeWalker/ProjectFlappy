# Project Flappy
One day, I had the honor of having lunch with some fine game developers.

We were talking about procedural generation, and the game developer mentioned that they had worked on a prototype similar to Flappy Birds with procedurally generated terrain.
Unfortunately, the game developer told me that the game had to be canceled because they could not figure out how to monetize it.

Now, I have seen many 'endless runner' games that have successfully monetized, so I became curious why the game developer said they could not find a way to monetize their game.

So I have decided to try it out for myself, is it really that difficult?

# Objectives
1. Make a full functioning endless runner game with Flappy Birds core gameplay and aesthetics.
2. Implement a satisfying meta game loop to ensure replay value.
3. Add a mock monetization layer (in-game ads, in-game purchase).
